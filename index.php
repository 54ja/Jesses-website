<h1>Mahurangi art </h1>
<h6> My name is Jesse Attwood, and I'm a year 12 student at Mahurangi college. I am the owner of the website Mahurangi art and have created it because I feel that the students here need a way to present the art work they have created. That's when I came up with the idea of creating a website that anyone would be able to use and excess for free to be able to view the artwork. If you have any questions or problems regarding the website, please email through the  <a class="contact h6" href="mailto: ja54@mahurangi.school.nz"><span>Contact</span></a> link at the top or email me at: ja54@mahurangi.school.nz </h6>
